Sublimall 0.0.25 Changelog:

As a reminder:

> I made the decision to stop Sublimall development. 
> But you have to know that Sublimall and server side source codes are already on Github and they will stay open source forever.
> Then, Sublimall is not dead! My second motivation behind Sublimall was to allow you to install your own instance for 
> your company or friends and you'll still able to do that.
>
> You can easily install Sublimall server on a Digital Ocean droplet for example. Just follow this guide.
> https://github.com/socketubs/sublimall-server/blob/master/INSTALL.md
